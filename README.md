The RingDecomposerLib is an ANSI-C library with a Python wrapper for
calculation of Unique Ring Families (URFs) and other cycle bases
(Relevant Cycles (RC), Smallest Set of Smallest Rings (SSSR)).

It has been developed at the
[University of Hamburg] (https://www.uni-hamburg.de/),
[ZBH - Center for Bioinformatics] (http://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de),
[Research Group for Computational Molecular Design] (http://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/amd)
by Niek Andresen, Florian Flachsenberg and Matthias Rarey.

The library is distributed under [BSD New] (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license.
